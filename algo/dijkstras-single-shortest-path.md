{% capture section_desc %}Given a graph, such as a road networks, one can use Dijkstras's algorithm to find the shortest paths between vertices in a graph. For example, if one needs to find the shortest path between locations a and b in the graph, the alorithm finds it using a greedy approach. Given the source node, the alogirhtm can eventually find shortest paths to all other vertices in the graph. The process of finding shortest paths includes a technique which updates the distance to unvisited vertices that is connected to the current vertice being explored.{% endcapture %}
{% capture section_complexity %}Given a graph G with n vertices, the queue in in BFS may contain 0(v).
Using BFS, one can find all the shortest paths in 0(V + E){% endcapture %}
